# Pega Auth

The **Pega Auth** repo is used to create the [**@pega/auth**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pega/auth) npm package.

This package contains 3 distinct libraries: oauth-client (default), auth-code-redirect and sdk-auth-manager

## oauth-client

The oauth-client library is the default library and is available by a simple import of '@pega/auth'. It implements simple OAuth client library for browser or Node cli clients to leverage OAuth services provided by Pega Infinity and Pega Launchpad. The methods facilitate the implementation of supported client-side initiated grant flows to the Pega Server. Presently it supports the following grant types: authorization code (with or without PKCE), client credentials, password credentials and custom bearer.

The library contains a single JS Class named PegaAuth, which facilitates the acquisition and management of OAuth tokens for a Web or Node client.

## auth-code-redirect

The auth-code-redirect library facilitates the transfer of a received code or error at the end of an authorization code grant flow to the oauth-client library code, so it may proceed with access_token acquisition or reacting or reporting to the error encountered.

## sdk-auth-manager

The library facilitates additional management of Authentication tokens as well as the bootstrapping of the Constellation Orchestration Engine and will be leveraged by the Pega Constellation SDKs for React and Angular and Web Components.

## oauth-client library usage

To leverage this library, import the **PegaAuth** class from the default @pega/auth package or from '@pega/auth/oauth-client'.

Main methods:

### constructor( ssKeyConfig, ssKeyDynState='')

The PegaAuth constructor takes one required argument (ssKeyConfig) which passes in an object with various configuration properties and values or is a string value indicating a sessionStorage key from which to read a JSON stringified representation of such a config object.

The constructor also has a 2nd optional argument (ssKeyDynState) which can either pass an initial empty object which should be used to place all dynamic state runtime property values, or may be a string value indicating a sessionStorage key from which to read and update such dynamic state. If omitted, and a string value is passed as first argument, '\_DS' is appended to that value and dynamic state is saved to that session storage location.

### async login()

The login method executes the specified OAuth 2.0 grantType and returns a promise which will contain the immediate or eventual token endpoint response.

### loginRedirect()

The loginRedirect method kicks off an authorization code grant flow on the main window (only relevant for grantType='authCode').

### checkStateMatch(state)

Returns true if the passed in state value matches the state which was set at the start of an authorization code grant flow (only relevant for grantType='authCode').

### getToken(authCode)

Uses the passed in authCode to retrieve the access_token and any optional refresh_token specified for the OAuth 2.0 client registration.

### async refreshToken(refreshToken)

Uses he passed in refreshToken to generate a new access_token as well as an updated refresh_token (if a refresh_token is enabled within the OAuth 2.0 client registration).

### async revokeTokens(accessToken, refreshToken=null)

Revoke the specified tokens to in effect end the authentication session.

### async getUserinfo(accessToken)

Retrieve the "user information" object associated with the passed in accessToken.
