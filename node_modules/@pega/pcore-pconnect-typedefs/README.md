# Installation

```
npm install --save-dev @pega/pcore-pconnect-typedefs@3.0.0
```


# Usage

#### In JavaScript project

##### Point to `@pega/pcore-pconnect-typeDefs` in `<project-root>/jsconfig.json`
```js
{
  "exclude": [],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "typeRoots": ["node_modules/@types", "node_modules/@pega"],
    "baseUrl": "./"
  }
}
```
##### Usage for `PCore` APIs
```js
PCore.getCascadeManager().registerFields();
```
##### Usage for `PConnect` API, Since getPConnect will be a prop inside the components and it'll be scoped with the component itself.
```js
const { getPConnect } = props;

/** @type {PConnect} */
const pConn = getPConnect();
